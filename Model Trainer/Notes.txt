Action should be in the shape of   (Frame, keypoints) (30, 258)

Pose has 132 indidividual key features
Hands has 21 in each hand. with 3 properties (x,y,z) making it 126

Pose + Hands = 258


Once all the data has been collected the shape will become (total number of sequences, Frame, Keypoints)
 (120, 30, 258) 

 This has 4 items of 30 sequences with 30 npy files.

 30* 4 = 120
 30 Frames
 258 keypoints
