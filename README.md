## What you need
- An IDE that can run Jupyter Notepook ipynb files (We reccomend VSCode).
- A Python 3.9 environment

## Run instructions
- Clone the repository to your local machine ```git clone https://github.com/CS4360-SeniorProject/SignLanguage.git```
- Navigate into ```SignLanguage > Model Trainer``` subdirectory
- Open ```Model_maker.ipynb``` in your IDE
- Click "Run All"
  !! Please note: It may take a while to run all the cells for the first time. If you do not already have a Python3 environment, VSCode can set it up for you. This will also take time. Please be patient, thank you. :]

## What our program should do
